# Dex++
![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AZYsGithub/DexPlusPlus/main/preview.png)

Dex++ is a maintained revival of Moon's Dex, made to fulfill some Moon's Dex prophecy.

## Latest Version Script
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/AZYsGithub/DexPlusPlus/releases/latest/download/out.lua"))()
```
For specific versions, go to [releases](https://github.com/AZYsGithub/DexPlusPlus/releases).

## What's the difference between Dex and Dex++?
Since the original Dex is the last release and Moon have discontinued it, it still has some missing features.
Here are the features that were added/fixed in Dex++
- Uses Konstant as fallback decompiler (for shitsploits who doesn't have it)
    > 'getscriptbytecode' is required
- Uses [USSI](https://github.com/luau/UniversalSynSaveInstance/tree/main) as fallback saveinstance
- Mobile Input Support (Window drag, resizing works fully on touch)
- Console Output
- Model Viewer (basically 3D Preview)
- Revived Save Instance (original Dex doesnt have it, but does in Dex 2.0)
- Click part to select (thx Toon :3)
- CodeFrame cursor offset (where cursor on textbox were not aligned properly)

## To Build
1. Download this repository
